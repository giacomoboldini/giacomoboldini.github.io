\cvsection{About Me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
    I am a PhD student in Computer Science focusing on static analysis,
    abstract interpretation, and program verification, with applications to
    low-level languages.
    My works (academic/personal/small-team) span topics such as parallel
    computing, GPU programming, AI applied to source code analysis, and web
    development for small to mid-sized websites.
    As an Arduino/ESP32/self-hosting enthusiast, I enjoy working on DIY
    projects, exploring embedded systems, and delving into network systems.

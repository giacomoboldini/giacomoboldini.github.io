**Research theme:** Implementation of parallel algorithms on GPU (transl.)
- Researched and implemented a new algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA/C++) for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of small symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices.
- Studied and utilized Tensor Core architecture of NVIDIA GPUs for reimplementation of proprietary numerical computation algorithms.
- Implemented two ad-hoc solutions with CUDA/C++ to improve performance, achieving a speedup of x2N in execution time for matrix diagonalization.

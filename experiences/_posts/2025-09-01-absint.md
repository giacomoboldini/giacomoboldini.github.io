- Designed and implemented a pre-analysis module within RuleChecker to address the (theoretically undecidable) detection of persistent side effects in C++ code.
- Developed a top-down traversal of the Clang AST using a visitor-pattern approach to extract semantic information from program syntax.
- Produced a prototype capable of collecting useful data for supporting MISRA C++ rule checking.
- Collaborated with the development team (approximately 20 people) through weekly meetings and technical discussions.
